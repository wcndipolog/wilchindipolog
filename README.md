### Hey there, I'm Wil!

I'm a software engineer passionate about building smart, scalable solutions that make everyday work smoother—especially in enterprise environments.

By day, I help develop packaged applications that power businesses, and by night, I explore modern web technologies to sharpen my skills and build personal projects.

Previously, I’ve contributed to projects that support internal teams and improve operational efficiency.
